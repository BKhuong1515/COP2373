Program Description:
Loads student grades from a CSV file, then calculates and
displays the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for each exam and overall grades.
Also determines pass/fail statistics and calculates the overall pass percentage.


1. Function Name: load_data
Description: This function loads grades data from a CSV file into a NumPy array.

Parameters:
    - file_name (str): The name of the CSV file containing the grades.
Variables:
    - data (numpy array): Contains the loaded grade data from the file.

Logical Steps:
    1. Attempt to load data using Numpy function.
    2. Handle errors if the file is not found.
    3. Display the loaded data.

Returns: A numpy array containing the grade data, else none.

2. Function Name: calculate_statistics
Description: This function calculates and displays statistics for each exam and the overall grades.

Parameters:
    - data (numpy array): The grade data to analyze.
    Variables:
    - overall_grades (numpy array): Flattened array of all grades for overall statistics.

Logical Steps:
    1. Transpose the data to separate each exam.
    2. Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for each exam.
    3. Flatten the data and calculate overall statistics.
    4. Display the results.

Returns: None.

3. Function Name: calculate_pass_fail
Description: This function calculates pass/fail statistics for each exam and the overall pass percentage.

Parameters:
    - data (numpy array): The grade data to analyze.

Variables:
    - total_passes (int): Total number of passing grades across all exams.
    - total_grades (int): Total number of grades across all exams.

Logical Steps:
    1. Transpose the data to separate each exam.
    2. Count the number of passes and fails for each exam.
    3. Calculate the overall pass percentage.
    4. Display the results.

Returns: None.

4. Function Name: main
Description: This function orchestrates the execution of the program.

Parameters: None

Variables:
    - file_name (str): The name of the CSV file containing the grades.

Logical Steps:
    1. Load the data from the specified CSV file using load_data.
    2. If data is loaded, call calculate_statistics and calculate_pass_fail.

Returns: None.

Logical Steps:
1. Call the load_data function to load grades from the CSV file.
2. If data is loaded successfully, call calculate_statistics to display statistical data.
3. Call calculate_pass_fail to display pass/fail statistics and overall pass percentage.
