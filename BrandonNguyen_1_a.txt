Assignment: Exercise 1A

Program Description:
This program simulates a ticket-selling process where a limited number of tickets are available for purchase.
The user can request to buy a certain number of tickets (between 1 and 4) until all tickets are sold out.
The program keeps track of the remaining tickets and the total number of buyers.

Logical Steps:
1. Prompt the user to enter the number of tickets they wish to buy (between 1 and 4).
2. Validate the number of tickets requested by the user.
3. Check if there are enough tickets left to fulfill the user's request.
4. If the request is valid and can be fulfilled:
   Deduct the requested tickets from the total tickets available.
5. Increment the total number of buyers.
6. Display the remaining tickets.
7. If the request is invalid or exceeds the remaining tickets, display an error message.
8. Continue the loop until all tickets are sold out.

Variables:
total_tickets: An integer initialized to 20, representing the total number of tickets available.
total_buyers: An integer initialized to 0, representing the total number of buyers who have successfully purchased tickets.
tickets_requested: An integer representing the number of tickets the user requests to buy.

Functions:
