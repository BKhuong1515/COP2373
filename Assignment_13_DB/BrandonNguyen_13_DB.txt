Program Description:
Simulates population growth for various cities in Florida over 2% growth for a 20-year period.
Also utilizes a SQLite database to store population data and
matplotlib to generate population growth plots for user-selected cities.

1. Function Name: create_population_db
Description: This function initializes a SQLite database to store population data
and populates it with initial population values for the year 2023.

Parameters: None

Variables:
  - conn (SQLite connection object): Used to connect to the SQLite database.
  - cursor (SQLite cursor object): Executes SQL queries on the database.
  - initial_population (list of tuples): Contains initial population data for cities.

Logical Steps:
  1. Connect to the SQLite database specified by DB_NAME.
  2. Create the population table if it does not already exist.
  3. Populate the table with initial data for 2023 if not already present.
  4. Commit changes and close the database connection.

Returns: None

2. Function Name: population_growth
Description: Calculates and simulates the population growth for each city over 20 years
and stores the data in the SQLite database.

Parameters: None

Variables:
  - conn (SQLite connection object): Used to connect to the SQLite database.
  - cursor (SQLite cursor object): Executes SQL queries on the database.
  - data (list of tuples): Stores city names and their 2023 population.
  - current_population (integer): Tracks the growing population of a city for each year.

Logical Steps:
  1. Retrieve all city names and their 2023 populations from the database.
  2. For each city, calculate the population for the next 20 years using the growth rate.
  3. Insert the calculated population for each year into the database.
  4. Commit changes and close the database connection.

Returns: None

3. Function Name: plot_population_growth
Description: Displays a list of cities for the user to choose from and generates a population growth graph for the selected city.

Parameters: None

Variables:
  - conn (SQLite connection object): Used to connect to the SQLite database.
  - cursor (SQLite cursor object): Executes SQL queries on the database.
  - cities (list of strings): Stores the names of all cities in the database.
  - choice (string): Stores the userâ€™s selection.
  - data (list of tuples): Stores the years and population data for the selected city.
  - years (list of integers): Extracted years for plotting.
  - populations (list of integers): Extracted population values for plotting.

Logical Steps:
  1. Retrieve the list of cities from the database.
  2. Display the list of cities to the user and prompt them to select one.
  3. Retrieve population data for the selected city from the database.
  4. Extract years and population values from the data.
  5. Generate and display a line plot of the population growth.
  6. Close the database connection.

Returns: None

4. Function Name: main
Description: Serves as the entry point for the program, calling all other functions in the correct order.

Parameters: None

Variables: None

Logical Steps:
  1. Call create_population_db to initialize the database.
  2. Call population_growth to simulate and store population growth data.
  3. Call plot_population_growth to provide a graphical representation of the data.

Returns: None

Logical Steps:
1. Call create_population_db to initialize the database with initial data.
2. Call population_growth to simulate and store population growth data.
3. Call plot_population_growth to provide a graphical representation of the data.
